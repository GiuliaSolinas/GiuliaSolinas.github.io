abstract: This Special Issue covers original research works that contribute to the ongoing  debate on whether established assumptions in extant management theories still hold true when faced with the pervasive diffusion and adoption of digital technologies. There are several digital technologies—e.g., Internet of Things, 5G, Cloud, Distributed Ledgers/Blockchain, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence—which, in isolation or jointly, provide new capabilities to economic actors. Such capabilities are often described as “transformational” and hereafter we refer to “digital transformation” as the wider institutional, strategic, organizational and implications for economic actors of digital technologies’ diffusion and adoption.
