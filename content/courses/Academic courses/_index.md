Teaching is for me a wonderful opportunity to make an impact on society by training the new generations and leveraging their critical thinking and analytical skills. When in a classroom, I blend frontal lessons with interactive sessions based on class discussions, which should be stimulating and solution driven.

I had the opportunity of translating my research knowledge into teaching contents. My teaching portfolio comprehends courses at the bachelor, master and executive level in the fields of corporate strategic management, organizational design, platforms, and innovation.
