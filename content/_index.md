        I am a data scientist based in Munich (DE) and with a career path in academia before turning to practice. I love training models and tinkering with features and parametrization: it may look very old-fashioned and ML-oriented, but, come on, everyone needs a dose of comfort food now and then.
        
        - 🔭 I’m currently working on agentic open-source frameworks, AI/GenAI pre-sales, and building demos using IBM wx orchestrate and wx ai
        - 🌱 I’m currently learning agentic AI design with a particular focus on AgentOps and governance for agents.
        - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on inspiring projects for making AI safer for everyone.
        - 💬 Ask me about walking trails for toddlers in the Alps.
        - 😄 Pronouns: she/her.
        - ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Switzerland, the UK, Denmark, and Germany, but I am Italian deep in my soul, so never ask me if I fancy a pineapple pizza.
