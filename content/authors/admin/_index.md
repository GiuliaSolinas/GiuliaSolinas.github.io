IBM Champion and experienced AI consultant and data scientist with 15 years of expertise in applied statistics, machine learning, and data-driven system design. I architect and prototype GenAI and NLP solutions—from RAG pipelines to semantic search assistants—while bridging business needs and technical execution across industries. As a practitioner and former university faculty member, I combine in-depth modeling expertise with cross-functional leadership in pre-sales, AI enablement, and enterprise consulting.

Curious about start-ups that do good in the world.

Loves mountains, pizza, and my family.
