In summer 2020, I had the pleasure of co-chairing a PDW session at the during the **Academy of Management Conference**, together with [Christina Wawarta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KIuvTCcAAAAJ&hl=en/), [Georg Reischauer ](https://sites.google.com/view/greischauer/). The podium discussion covered the role of **digitization in strategizing** with a panel of experts. 

What is the matter? Digital technologies such as platforms, big data analytics, and algorithms are reshaping how firms strategize. A first effect is **altering the strategy-making process**, which has become less exclusive and secret, and more flexible. Second, digital technologies are also **redefining strategy-making practices**, allowing actors to participate from afar or utilizing the wisdom of the crowd. 

We discussed these two effects, their significance for business, and their influence on the strategic management research agenda.

Who was be "on the stage" with us? **Stefan Haefliger** (Cass Business School, UK) **Julia Hautz** (U. of Innsbruck, AUT), **Ann Majchrzak** (U. of Southern California, USA), **Stella Pachidi** (U. of Cambridge, UK), **Sotirios Paroutis** (Warwick Business School, UK), **Richard Whittington** (U. of Oxford, UK).
